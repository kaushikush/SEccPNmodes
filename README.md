# Spin-effects-in-Spherical-Harmonic-Modes-of-Gravitational-Waves-from-Eccentric-Compact-Binary-Inspiral

* This repository contains the small eccentricity (expanded to 6th power in eccentricity, $O(e^7)$ ) expressions of spin effects (linear-in-spin and quadratic-in-spin) to 2PN and non-spinning contributions to 3PN in spherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waveform from eccentric compact binary inspirals in a Mathematica readable file named [Suppl_PaulMishra2022.m](https://github.com/kaushikush/SEccPNmodes/blob/main/Suppl_PaulMishra2022.m). 

* The full waveform modes are in the form
           $$h^{\ell m} =\frac{8 G M nu}{c^2 R} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{5}} x e^{-i m \Psi} H^{\ell m}$$

>  where, nu : Symmetric mass ratio.
> chiaZ : z-component of the symmetric combination of dimensionless spins. 
> chisZ : z-component of the anti-symmetric combination of dimensionless spins. 
>  xi : phasing variable related to mean-anomaly.
> x : post-Newtonian parameter.
>  e : time-eccentricity.
